# Project Overview

To ensure your `README.md` captures both the **frontend** and **Node.js backend** aspects of your project, you need to clearly describe the structure, setup, and features of both parts. Here's an updated version of your `README.md`:

## About ✍️

Educare is a comprehensive platform tailored specifically for students. It combines a **frontend** built with modern web technologies and a **Node.js backend** to provide a seamless experience for students to ask questions, share knowledge, and collaborate.

---

## Features 🌠

Here’s what makes Educare stand out:

### Frontend Features

- 📖 **Ask & Answer**:
  Students can post questions in different subjects (e.g., math, science, literature). Other students can answer these questions, share explanations, or suggest study resources.

- 🏆 **Upvotes & Badges**:
  Students can upvote helpful answers, encouraging quality content.

- 🌐 **Subject Categories & Search**:
  Questions are organized by subject categories (e.g., math, biology, history) for easy browsing. A search bar allows students to quickly find specific topics or questions.

- 🤖 **AI Assistance**:
  Use cutting-edge AI technology to get instant solutions and insights into complex concepts.

### Backend Features

- 🚀 **RESTful API**:
  The backend provides a RESTful API to handle user authentication, question posting, answer submission, and upvoting.

- 🔒 **Authentication & Authorization**:
  Secure user authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

- 🗃️ **Database Integration**:
  MongoDB is used to store user data, questions, answers, and other relevant information.

- 🤖 **AI Integration**:
  The backend integrates with AI services to provide instant solutions and insights.
