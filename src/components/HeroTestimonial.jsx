              I thought it was going to take me for ever to land a job but with
              the help of this app, I was able to learn a skill, build my
              profile and get connected to the right people. Here I am now.

              Getting to hear other peoples stories and life experience is a
              plus here. I wasnâ€™t the best at having the right attitude to work
              or having a good relationship with people. That all changed when I
              came across EduCARE. I work and earn during the holidays too.

              My child has made a lot of improvement ever since Aunty Sharon has
              been teaching him with Educare. At least he now has knowledge of
              what she should know at her age. He won't feel left out in the
              society.
